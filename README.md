####    Typography
   + The Exo format is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans-Serif as the fallback font if the font is not imported into the site correctly. Exo is a clean font which was picked as a good fit with the content and imagery used.

   + Wireframes were made using Balsamiq Wireframes.
